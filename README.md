# mLib
Welcome to use mLib! mLib is a library that includes functions and classes coded by me. Maybe there're some treasure functions you are looking for here! My projects are almost using it. mLib is under MIT License.

To use mLib in your code, you need to install Visual C++, because mLib is using it. If you choose Visual Studio as your IDE, you don't need to install it in addition. mMath and mCode is not using Visual C++, and you can compile them with standard C++.

Note: The earlier introducions (including release introductions) are Chinese. The new ones will be English.

Now it's including the following sub-lib：
## 1. mFunction
Many small and useful functions are here.
## 2. mGraphics.h
Graphics drawing based on Direct 2D.
1. mGraphics/image.h, Image loading, saving and drawing.
2. mGraphics/figure.h, Drawing for science.
## 3. mMath
Mathematics.
1. mMath/geometry.h, Geometry.
2. mMath/algebra.h, Algebra.
3. mMath/num.h，Multi-dimension array imitating Numpy.
4. mMath/value.h, Value chain,, mainly used for auto derivation。
5. mMath/numEx.h, High precision number。
## 4. mWeb
Web.Though here's no more introduction, but it's not simple!
## 5. mCode
Encode and decode (Base64，UTF-8，URI)。
## 6. mDnn
Neural network. It's excellent.
1. mNetwork/layers.h, Neural network layers.
2. mNetwork/AOLR.h, Activate functions, O, Loss functions, R。
