- mFunction
  Many relatively small and useful functions are here.
- mGraphics
  Graphics drawing based on Direct2D.
- mMath
  Mathematics.
- mWeb
  Web. Though here's no much introduction, but it's not simple!
- mCode
  Encoding and decoding (Base64, UTF-8, URI).
- mDnn
  Neural network. It's an excellent lib.

## Situation

mLib lacks maintain. Some part of it still works well but other parts don't.
