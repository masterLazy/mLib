# mLib

## Introduction

mLib collects some codes that code by mLazy. He use this lib in his projects. mLib includes the following sub-libs:

- mFunction
  Many relatively small and useful functions are here.
- mGraphics
  Graphics drawing based on Direct2D.
- mMath
  Mathematics.
- mWeb
  Web. Though here's no much introduction, but it's not simple!
- mCode
  Encoding and decoding (Base64, UTF-8, URI).
- mDnn
  Neural network. It's an excellent lib.

## Situation

mLib lacks maintain, and it's a immature lib with many unknown bugs. mLazy is going to create another lib in the future. But this lib will be retained, maybe.
