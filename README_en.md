# mLib

## Introduction

mLib collects some codes that code by mLazy. He use this lib in his projects. mLib includes the following sub-libs:

- ### mFunction

  Many small and useful functions are here.

- ### mGraphics

  Graphics drawing based on Direct2D. Including basic drawing, science figure and image rendering.

- ### mMath

  Mathematics objects. Including geometry, algebra, value chain and high-precision numbers.

## Requirements

To run mLib, you need to install Visual C++.

## Situation

There're 2 branches in mLib. The `classic` is the old version of mLib that includes more sub-libs but lacks maintain. In this branch mLazy deletes some sub-libs and they are maintained. mLib is more modern and mature in this branch.

mLazy plans to create some other repositories to replace some of the deleted sub-lib. For example, [LazyWeb](github.com/masterlazy/lazyweb) replaces mWeb (in the branch `classic`).
